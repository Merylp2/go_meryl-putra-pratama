Recursive   - Recursion is a state in which a function solves a problem by calling itself repeatedly
            - If the problem is small enough, the recursion function can generate an immediate answer
            - If the problem is too big, the function will call itself with the smaller problem scope
  
Recursion strategy  - Base case (what is the simplest case of this problem?)
                    - Recurrence relations (what is the recursive relationship of this problem with similar smaller problems?)

Number theory > Number theory is a branch of mathematics that studies integers. There are a lot of topics in the field of number theory is Prime number, Greatesr common divisor, Least common multiple, Factorial, Prime factor, etc.

Searching > Searching is the process of finding a given value position in a list of values

Sorting > Is the process of arranging data in a certain order. Usually, we sort by the value of the elements. We can sort number, word, pair, etc. For example, we can sort students by their height, and we can sort cities in alphabetical order or by their numbers of citizens. The most used orders are numerical order and alphabetical order.
