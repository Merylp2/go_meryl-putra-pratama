> INTRODUCTION SOFTWARE TESTING

A process of analyzing a software item to detect the differences between existing and required conditions and to evaluate the features of the software item

> PURPOSE OF TESTING

- Preventing regression
- Confidence level in refactoring
- Improve code design
- Code documentation
- Scalling the team

> LEVEL OF TESTING

- UI : (End to end) Test the interaction between. The overall through the user interface
- INTERGRATION : Tests a specific modules or sub-system through the API
- UNIT : Tests the smallest testable part (single logical operation) of an application through methods

> FRAMEWORK

Framework provides tool, and structure necessary to run Testing Efficiently

> STRUCTURE

2 usual pattern
- Centralize your test file inside tests folder
- Save the file together with production file

> RUNNER

- Tool that run the test file
- Use watch mode (if there is change in codebase, automatically run test again, make TDD more efficient)
- Choose a runner that can run fastest
