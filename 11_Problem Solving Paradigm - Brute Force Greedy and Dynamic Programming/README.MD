Problem solving paradigm > Problem solving pardigms is approach commonly used to solve problems: Complete Search (a.k.a Brute Force), divide and conquer, the greedy approach, and dynamic programming. Every problem we need to solve with suitable approach.

Complete search - Complete search (also known as) Bruteforce is a method for solving a problem by traversing the entire search space to obtain the required solution
                - Bruteforce happen when no other algorithm available.
                - Usually easy to write because it's straightforward.
                - Theoretically all problem can be solved using Brute force approach especially when you have unlimited time.

Divide and coquer > Divide & conquer (D&C) is a problem solving paradigm in which a problem is made by simpler by 'dividing' it into smaller parts and then conquering each part

Greedy > An algorithm is said to be greedy if it makes the locally optiimal choice at each step with the hope of eventually reaching the globally optimal solution. In some cases, greedy works - the solution is short and runs efficiently

Dynamic programming > Dynamic programming (DP) is an algorithm technique for solving an optimization problem by breaking it down into simpler subproblems and utilizing the fact that the optimal solution to the overall problem depends upon the optimal solution to its subproblems
